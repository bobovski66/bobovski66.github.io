    <p>Certainly one of the most useful things about flat Euclidean space, non-exotic R^n, is that it has a set of <em>global smooth coordinates</em>. But what are coordinates? When we talk about “manifolds”, we are talking about (topological) spaces that <em>locally look like Euclidean space</em>. For example, the surface of the Earth is an oblate 2d-spheroid, it can be approximated by a smooth manifold. But if you “zoom in” enough, as we are well aware, it looks like you can approximate it by a plane. The approximation depends on the <em>curvature</em> of the surface, more on that at a later date. (In fact, you cannot zoom in close enough on a sphere so as not to detect the curvature. This is Gauss’ celebrated “Remarkable Theorem”: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorema_Egregium</a>.) </p>
    <p>Coordinates are, loosely, a way of setting up a local system of “graph paper” on a manifold so that one can do calculations the same way one does in regular, old, Euclidean space in calculus classes. Coordinates are a way of identifying the <em>where</em> and the <em>how</em> of points in the space and their relations to nearby points. To understand exotic manifolds, it’s necessary to think about coordinates as functions from the Euclidean approximation to the manifold itself.</p>

    <p>If M is a 1-dimensional manifold, then there is a <em>coordinate function</em> x that associates to a real number p an element x(p) in M and upon which the function x:R^1 →U is a smooth correspondence on a neighborhood U of x(p). That mouthful is to say “locally M looks like R^1 with coordinate x(p)”.</p>
    <p>Certainly an example is in order. Let M be the real line R^1. Then, a coordinate on M is x(p)=p. In other words, the real line is a manifold and you can put coordinates on it that match the numbers. It is this set of coordinates that provides R^1 with its <em>standard smooth structure</em>. Another coordinate on R^1 is x(p) = p^3. Readers with some calculus background will notice that the inverse function p(x) = x^(1/3) is <em>not</em> differentiable, or smooth, at the origin; it has a vertical rate of change:</p>

    <p>So, if one wishes to <em>define</em> x(p) = p^3 as a coordinate function on the smooth manifold R^1, then technically you have a function (the reverse correspondence x^(1/3)) that is differentiable in this “new” R^1 that is not differentiable in the “old” R^1. This would indicate a difference in smooth structure.</p>
    <p>To a physicist, this is not the kind of change in smooth structure that leads to exotic physics. Rather, what one should be concerned with is what are called <em>isotopy classes</em> of smooth functions. This is a technical definition that we have encountered before when we saw that the three sphere S^3 has no exotic smooth structure. What’s important here is</p>
    <p><em>For n=1,2,3,5,6,…, R^n has exactly one smooth structure, up to isotopy.</em></p>
    <p>What this means is that R^4 is the only Euclidean space where coordinate functions can act different from the way one would expect from calculus. Indeed, there are uncountably infinite non-equivalent smooth structures on R^4. These exotic Euclidean spaces will come in two sizes: large and small, and will often involve “wild” inclusions of 3D submanifolds in them, similar to the Witten trick for spheres.</p>
    <p>As we move forward, we will discuss large and small exotic R^4s, and try to wrap our minds around how “exotic-ness” is a true, global property of a manifold.</p>
