<h1 id="what-are-llms-and-ai">What Are LLMs and AI?</h1>
<p>To understand how to use AI tools effectively in an academic setting,
it is essential first to know what Large Language Models (LLMs) and
artificial intelligence (AI) are, and how they function. This section
provides a brief overview of these technologies and their applications
in education.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-artificial-intelligence-ai">Understanding
Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These
processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for
using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or
definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI has various subfields,
including machine learning, where algorithms improve through experience,
and natural language processing (NLP), which focuses on the interaction
between computers and human languages.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-large-language-models-llms">What Are Large Language
Models (LLMs)?</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a specific type of AI designed to
understand, generate, and manipulate human language in a way that is
contextually relevant and coherent. Examples of LLMs include GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models like ChatGPT, Claude,
MetaAI, Gemini, and other similar AI tools. These models are trained on
vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, articles, and more,
enabling them to generate responses based on the patterns and knowledge
encoded in their training data.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-llms-work">How Do LLMs Work?</h2>
<p>LLMs work by predicting the next word in a sequence of text, given
all the previous words in the sequence. This is achieved through a
process called <em>transformer architecture</em>, which allows the model
to consider the context of each word in a sentence, thereby generating
coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Key features of LLMs
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Text Generation:</strong> LLMs can produce human-like
text based on prompts provided by users. This includes writing essays,
solving math problems, and even creating poetry or coding
scripts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text Comprehension:</strong> These models can understand
and analyze text, summarizing content, explaining concepts, or answering
questions based on provided information.</p></li>

appropriately. Below are examples of acceptable use cases, along with
sample conversations to guide students in how to effectively interact
with AI while maintaining academic integrity.</p>
<h2 id="brainstorming-and-idea-generation">Brainstorming and Idea
Generation</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A student can use ChatGPT to brainstorm
ideas for a math project on chaos theory.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<div class="mdframed">
<div class="flushleft">
<p><strong>Student:</strong> I need to come up with some ideas for a
project on chaos theory in my math class. Can you help me brainstorm
some topics?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure! Here are a few ideas: 1. Explore the
mathematical foundations of chaos theory, such as the butterfly effect
and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. 2. Investigate
real-world applications of chaos theory, like weather prediction, stock
market analysis, or population dynamics. 3. Create a simulation that
demonstrates chaotic behavior in a dynamical system, such as the Lorenz
attractor.</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Thanks! I like the idea of exploring
real-world applications. Can you help me narrow it down to one specific
area?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> How about focusing on weather prediction?
You could look into how small changes in initial conditions can lead to
vastly different weather outcomes over time, illustrating the concept of
chaos in meteorology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="clarifying-concepts-already-covered-in-class">Clarifying
Concepts Already Covered in Class</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A student uses ChatGPT to better understand
the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which was covered in
class.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<div class="mdframed">
<div class="flushleft">
<p><strong>Student:</strong> I learned about eigenvalues and
eigenvectors in my math class, but Iâ€™m still a bit confused. Can you
explain what they are in simple terms?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Absolutely! Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
are concepts from linear algebra. In simple terms, an eigenvector is a
vector that doesnâ€™t change its direction when a linear transformation is
applied to it, although it might get stretched or shrunk. The eigenvalue
is the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk. If you
think of a transformation as a function that moves and scales objects in
space, eigenvectors point in the directions that remain unchanged by
that transformation, while eigenvalues tell you how much the stretching
or shrinking happens along those directions.</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> That makes sense! Could you give an example
of how this is used in a real-world application?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure! One example is in facial recognition
technology. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in algorithms that
recognize patterns in data, such as identifying faces in images. The
technique, called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), uses eigenvectors
to find the directions in which the data varies the most, which helps in
reducing the dimensionality of the data and identifying the most
significant features for recognizing faces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="practice-problems-and-additional-explanations">Practice Problems
and Additional Explanations</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A student practices solving integrals using

<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<div class="mdframed">
<div class="flushleft">
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Can you provide me with a practice problem
involving integration by parts?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Certainly! Hereâ€™s a practice problem for
you: Evaluate the integral <span
class="math inline">âˆ«<em>x</em><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€†<em>d</em><em>x</em></span>
using integration by parts.</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Let me try it. If I set <span
class="math inline"><em>u</em>â€„=â€„<em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>v</em>â€„=â€„<em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup><em>d</em><em>x</em></span>,
then <span
class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>u</em>â€„=â€„<em>d</em><em>x</em></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>v</em>â€„=â€„<em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup></span>.
So, <span
class="math inline">âˆ«<em>x</em><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€†<em>d</em><em>x</em>â€„=â€„<em>x</em><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€…âˆ’â€…âˆ«<em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€†<em>d</em><em>x</em>â€„=â€„<em>x</em><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€…âˆ’â€…<em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup>â€…+â€…<em>C</em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Thatâ€™s correct! Nice work. Integration by
parts is a useful technique when you have a product of functions where
one is easily differentiable (like <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>) and the other is easily
integrable (like <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sup><em>x</em></sup></span>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="simulating-discussions-on-mathematical-theories">Simulating
Discussions on Mathematical Theories</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A student engages in a discussion with
ChatGPT to understand the implications of GÃ¶delâ€™s Incompleteness
Theorems.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<div class="mdframed">
<div class="flushleft">
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Iâ€™ve heard about GÃ¶delâ€™s Incompleteness
Theorems, but Iâ€™m not sure what they imply for mathematics. Can you
explain?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> GÃ¶delâ€™s Incompleteness Theorems are two
fundamental results in mathematical logic that have profound
implications for the foundations of mathematics. The first theorem
states that in any consistent formal system that is capable of
expressing basic arithmetic, there are statements that are true but
cannot be proven within the system. The second theorem states that no
such system can demonstrate its own consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Wow, thatâ€™s interesting. Does this mean
there are limitations to what we can know in mathematics?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Exactly. GÃ¶delâ€™s theorems imply that there
are always going to be some truths in mathematics that we cannot prove
using a given set of axioms. This has a major impact on the philosophy
of mathematics, suggesting that our mathematical knowledge is inherently
incomplete and that there are always limits to what we can formally
prove.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A student uses ChatGPT to generate an
entire assignment and submits it without modification or
understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong></p>
<div class="mdframed">
<div class="flushleft">
<p><strong>Student:</strong> Can you write an essay on the history of
calculus for me?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Sure, hereâ€™s a brief essay: Calculus is a
branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the
accumulation of quantities. Its origins can be traced back to ancient
Greece, but it was developed into its modern form by Isaac Newton and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century...</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> (Copies the text directly into their
assignment without understanding or rephrasing any of the content.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Why This Is Unacceptable:</strong> Submitting AI-generated
