\subsection{Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI has various subfields, including machine learning, where algorithms improve through experience, and natural language processing (NLP), which focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages.

\subsection{What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a specific type of AI designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language in a way that is contextually relevant and coherent. Examples of LLMs include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models like ChatGPT, Claude, MetaAI, Gemini, and other similar AI tools. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, articles, and more, enabling them to generate responses based on the patterns and knowledge encoded in their training data.

\subsection{How Do LLMs Work?}

LLMs work by predicting the next word in a sequence of text, given all the previous words in the sequence. This is achieved through a process called \textit{transformer architecture}, which allows the model to consider the context of each word in a sentence, thereby generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Key features of LLMs include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Text Generation:} LLMs can produce human-like text based on prompts provided by users. This includes writing essays, solving math problems, and even creating poetry or coding scripts.

\subsection{Brainstorming and Idea Generation}

\textbf{Example:} A student can use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for a math project on chaos theory.

\textbf{Conversation:}
\begin{mdframed}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Student:} I need to come up with some ideas for a project on chaos theory in my math class. Can you help me brainstorm some topics?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} Sure! Here are a few ideas:
1. Explore the mathematical foundations of chaos theory, such as the butterfly effect and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
2. Investigate real-world applications of chaos theory, like weather prediction, stock market analysis, or population dynamics.
3. Create a simulation that demonstrates chaotic behavior in a dynamical system, such as the Lorenz attractor.

\textbf{Student:} Thanks! I like the idea of exploring real-world applications. Can you help me narrow it down to one specific area?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} How about focusing on weather prediction? You could look into how small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different weather outcomes over time, illustrating the concept of chaos in meteorology.
\end{flushleft}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection{Clarifying Concepts Already Covered in Class}

\textbf{Example:} A student uses ChatGPT to better understand the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which was covered in class.

\textbf{Conversation:}
\begin{mdframed}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Student:} I learned about eigenvalues and eigenvectors in my math class, but I'm still a bit confused. Can you explain what they are in simple terms?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} Absolutely! Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts from linear algebra. In simple terms, an eigenvector is a vector that doesn't change its direction when a linear transformation is applied to it, although it might get stretched or shrunk. The eigenvalue is the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk. If you think of a transformation as a function that moves and scales objects in space, eigenvectors point in the directions that remain unchanged by that transformation, while eigenvalues tell you how much the stretching or shrinking happens along those directions.

\textbf{Student:} That makes sense! Could you give an example of how this is used in a real-world application?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} Sure! One example is in facial recognition technology. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in algorithms that recognize patterns in data, such as identifying faces in images. The technique, called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), uses eigenvectors to find the directions in which the data varies the most, which helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and identifying the most significant features for recognizing faces.
\end{flushleft}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection{Practice Problems and Additional Explanations}

\textbf{Example:} A student practices solving integrals using ChatGPT for additional exercises and explanations.

\textbf{Conversation:}
\begin{mdframed}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Student:} Can you provide me with a practice problem involving integration by parts?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} Certainly! Here's a practice problem for you:
Evaluate the integral \(\int x e^x \, dx\) using integration by parts.

\textbf{Student:} Let me try it. If I set \(u = x\) and \(dv = e^x dx\), then \(du = dx\) and \(v = e^x\). So, \(\int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C\).

\textbf{ChatGPT:} That's correct! Nice work. Integration by parts is a useful technique when you have a product of functions where one is easily differentiable (like \(x\)) and the other is easily integrable (like \(e^x\)).
\end{flushleft}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection{Simulating Discussions on Mathematical Theories}

\textbf{Example:} A student engages in a discussion with ChatGPT to understand the implications of G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorems.

\textbf{Conversation:}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Student:} I've heard about G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorems, but I'm not sure what they imply for mathematics. Can you explain?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorems are two fundamental results in mathematical logic that have profound implications for the foundations of mathematics. The first theorem states that in any consistent formal system that is capable of expressing basic arithmetic, there are statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. The second theorem states that no such system can demonstrate its own consistency.

\textbf{Student:} Wow, that's interesting. Does this mean there are limitations to what we can know in mathematics?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} Exactly. G\"{o}del's theorems imply that there are always going to be some truths in mathematics that we cannot prove using a given set of axioms. This has a major impact on the philosophy of mathematics, suggesting that our mathematical knowledge is inherently incomplete and that there are always limits to what we can formally prove.
\end{flushleft}
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Conversation:}
\begin{mdframed}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Student:} Whatâ€™s the solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 7\)?

\textbf{ChatGPT:} To solve for \(x\), subtract 3 from both sides to get \(2x = 4\). Then divide both sides by 2 to find \(x = 2\).

\textbf{Student:} (Writes down the solution without understanding the steps involved or attempting to solve it independently.)
\end{flushleft}
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Why This Is Unacceptable:} Using AI to bypass the learning process prevents the student from developing essential problem-solving skills. It undermines the purpose of education, which is to foster understanding and critical thinking.

\subsection{Misrepresenting AI-Assisted Work as Entirely Personal Effort}
