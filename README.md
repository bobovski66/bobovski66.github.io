# Christopher Lee-Jenkins

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects spanning mathematics, machine learning, financial modeling, and computational research.

## About Me

I am a mathematician, researcher, and educator with a PhD in mathematics. My work blends pure mathematics, data science, and computational modeling. My research interests include:
- Symplectic and contact topology
- Neural network feature clustering and topological data analysis (TDA)
- Stochastic differential equations and financial modeling
- Nonlinear Schrödinger equations and soliton theory
- Graph theory applications in biology and network science
